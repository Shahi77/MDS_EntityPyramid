But the Turkish person's brain was preserved not by water or ice, but by fire, according to New Scientist. The final factor in the brains' preservation was the chemistry of the soil, which is rich in potassium, magnesium and aluminium, and it effectively preserved the shape of the soft brain tissue.

The 4,000-year-old organ was found in Seyitömer Höyük, a Bronze Age settlement, and researchers think its owner was likely killed when an earthquake buried him under rubble. A fire probably then spread, eating up any oxygen in the rubble, and basically boiling the brain inside the skull. The lack of oxygen and moisture would explain how the brain tissue, which is soft and full of fat and typically breaks down quickly, was preserved. The soil also helped"
